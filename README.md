As part of our project under the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell (IEDC) at UKFCET, we have developed a humanoid robot to showcase the capabilities of our AI chatbot, EVA. Our team consists of five members, each contributing to different aspects of the development.

EVA is an AI chatbot similar to Alexa or Siri, capable of performing a variety of tasks. The software is installed within the humanoid robot, allowing it to demonstrate these functionalities to the public. Our team members actively participated in presenting the robot, engaging with the audience to highlight its interactive features.

In addition to the chatbot functionality, I created an HTML file designed to display the features and introduction page of EVA. This page is presented on a monitor located in the chest area of the robot, providing users with an overview of EVA's capabilities and functions.

This project represents our effort to combine software engineering with robotics, showcasing our ability to develop innovative and interactive AI applications. Below are some pictures of the humanoid robot, reflecting our hard work and creativity.
