I have collaborated in the development of EVA, an AI chatbot similar to Alexa or Siri, capable of performing a variety of tasks. This software is installed in a humanoid robot named EVA, which is part of our college project. Our team consists of five members, each contributing to different aspects of the development.

In addition to the chatbot functionality, I created an HTML file designed to display the features and introduction page of EVA. This page is presented on a monitor located in the chest area of the robot, providing users with an overview of EVA's capabilities and functions.

This project represents our effort to combine software engineering with robotics, showcasing our ability to develop interactive and functional AI applications
